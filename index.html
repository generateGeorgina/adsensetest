            <h2>Why Choose Jest?</h2>
            <p>"Jest" is a popular JavaScript testing library that is chosen by many developers and quality assurance engineers for a variety of reasons. Here are some key reasons why Jest is a preferred choice for testing.</p>
            <h3>Comprehensive Testing Framework</h3>
            <p>Jest is a comprehensive and all-in-one testing framework that provides a wide range of tools and utilities to simplify the testing process. Whether you need to perform unit testing, integration testing, or end-to-end testing, Jest has you covered. Its versatility makes it an excellent choice for both small-scale projects and large, complex applications.</p>
            <h3>Easy Setup and Configuration</h3>
            <p>Getting started with Jest is a breeze. It offers a simple and intuitive setup process, making it accessible to developers of all experience levels. With minimal configuration, you can start writing and executing tests in no time. This ease of use is particularly appealing to beginners looking to incorporate testing into their projects seamlessly.</p>
            <h3>Built-in Test Runner</h3>
            <p>One of Jest's standout features is its built-in test runner. It automatically finds and executes your test files, eliminating the need for additional configuration or setup. The test runner's speed and efficiency make it a go-to choice for developers who value productivity and quick feedback during the testing phase.</p>
            <h3>Snapshot Testing</h3>
            <p>Jest introduces the concept of snapshot testing, which simplifies the verification of UI components and complex data structures. It allows you to capture the output of your code and compare it to a stored reference. This makes it easy to identify unexpected changes in your application's output and ensures that your UI remains consistent across updates.</p>
            <h3>Mocking Capabilities</h3>
            <p>Jest's mocking capabilities are second to none. It allows you to create mocks for dependencies, functions, and modules, enabling isolated unit testing. This feature is invaluable when you want to isolate the code you're testing and avoid unintended side effects from external dependencies.</p>
            <h3>Active Community and Support</h3>
            <p>Jest benefits from a vibrant and active community of developers and testers. This community continually contributes to its growth, shares best practices, and provides support through various forums and resources. Whether you're a newcomer or an experienced tester, you'll find ample resources and discussions to help you on your testing journey.</p>
            <h3>Integration with Popular Tools</h3>
            <p>Jest seamlessly integrates with other popular tools in the JavaScript ecosystem. For example, it works well with Babel for transpilation, making it suitable for modern JavaScript projects. Additionally, it integrates with testing utilities like React Testing Library, enabling efficient testing of React components.</p>
            <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
            <p>Jest is developed and maintained by Facebook, a company known for its commitment to open-source projects. As a result, Jest benefits from continuous improvement and updates. New features and enhancements are regularly introduced to keep up with the evolving needs of the testing community.</p>
