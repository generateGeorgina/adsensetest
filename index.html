            <h2>Under the mango tree</h2>
            <p>If you don't have a sewing machine, you… you can't sew. So, when you finish the apprenticeship, using the same machine, you can open your business. Like, in the corridor, you set the table and then you put the machine. They see you and say, “this lady knows how to sew, this lady knows how to sew”. That's it. Two or three people come and sew, it's perfect. That's it. Make money. This is a business. In Africa, opening a business is not hard. In all weather, sometimes under a mango tree, you can put your table and your machine. You cut the material, that's it. No electricity. You use a hand-machine and erm.. a 'box iron'. You put charcoal in the iron, that's it. No electricity. The mango tree… you can open your business under the mango tree. A mango tree or a coconut tree. Any place that is quiet, cool and in the shade. Not in the sun. Under any tree you can set your machine. Christmas a lot of people come to sew because there are more events. You have to do it at night time. So… people come to the mango tree and they bring you songs you know… entertainment because nobody wants to go to bed so I'm sewing, sewing, sewing. Maybe at 10 o'clock you go to bed or at 12 o'clock you go to bed. The mango tree was behind the house in my village. They talk, chat, drink, er… what do you call it… poems, songs… everybody was outside.
